# meyer-sequencer
Meyer is an experimental sequencer written in purr data. While delivering the usual tried and true functions, it features several interesting and even some unique qualities:

- a random Sequence generator
- Parameters can be set to unusual extreme values
- sequences can automatically mutate over time
- 32 Steps, adjustable length of sequence
- Monophonic/Polyphonic
- tonal/chromatic output
- random deviations in pitch and velocity
- random note output


ToDo

- mutation: seperate Volume und Pitch
- mutation: different styles (up/down/upDown/etc. or adjust direction via slider)
- mutation: more modes of distribution for the values (x², x³, x⁴, etc.)
- triplets via the externe clock
- makenote and scale for every extra output for every step
- control-inlet for every switch and slider
- help-patch
