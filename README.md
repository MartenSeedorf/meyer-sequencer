Meyer is an experimental sequencer written in purr data. While delivering the usual tried and true functions, it features several interesting and even some unique qualities:

- a random Sequence generator
- Parameters can be set to unusual extreme values
- sequences can automatically mutate over time
- 32 Steps, adjustable length of sequence
- Monophonic/Polyphonic
- tonal/chromatic output
- random deviations in pitch and velocity
- random note output


ToDo

- triplets via the externe clock
- control-inlet for every switch and slider
- help-patch
